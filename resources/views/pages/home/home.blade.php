		<h1>What We Do</h1>
		<div class='content left'>
			<h3>Hackathons</h3>
			<p>
				Hackathons are 36 hour coding competitions and the fastest way to build
				the project of your dreams. We send buses to hackathons across the
				country almost every week. While you're hacking, you can get to know
				representatives from companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and more!
				Plus, every hackathon is filled to the brim with free food and free swag.
			</p>
			<h3>Social Events</h3>
			<p>
				Every few weeks Purdue Hackers hosts events where people
				hang out, work on projects, share ideas, and learn
				about cool new technologies. We strive to create an environment
				where it's easy to meet some of the students at the forefront of
				innovation at Purdue. We also invite speakers from cutting edge
				companies in the industry to share their experience with us.

		<h1>FAQ</h1>
		<div class='faq-img'></div>
		<div class='content right'>
			<h3>What is hacking?</h3>
			<p>
				You&#39;re probably thinking of movies where hackers steal
				secrets from the FBI. That&#39;s not what we&#39;re about.
				To us, hacking means using cutting edge technology to create kick-ass projects.
			<p>
			<h3>I missed the callout!<br>Can I still join?</h3>
			<p>
				Absolutely! You can find all of our events in the Purdue Hackers
				<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/purduehackers/" target="_blank">facebook group</a>. No prior knowledge or experience is needed, so come say hi!
			</p>
			<h3>What if I can&#39;t code?</h3>
			<p>
				No problem! As long as you&#39;re passionate about how
				technology can shape the future, you&#39;ll fit right in. We offer
				lots of events to help teach coding skills, including a semester-long
				coding bootcamp called Ignite.
			</p>
			<h3>What&#39;s up with the logo?</h3>
			<p>
				It&#39;s a glider from Conway&#39;s Game of Life. It&#39;s a
				universal symbol for hacking and was chosen because it&#39;s the
				only pattern in the game that can spread life to new areas.
